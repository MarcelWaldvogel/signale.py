# Introduction

It is fun to make a **Command Line App** and adventurous to make it look beautiful. If you have ever used **Node.js** to make CLI Apps you might have definately heard of **Signale**, *Hackable Console Logger*. It helps in creating beautiful looking logs for your app but this doesn't help when using **Python** as it is a Node.js Library.

Thats why Signale.py was created. **Signale.py** is a python library inspired by the Node.js library Signale. Its main motive is to create *Elegant Looking Logs For Python Command Line Apps*.
